## Algorithms

### Las Vegas Algorithm

The Las Vegas algorithms are randomized algorithms that guarantee correctness with a certain probability, usually through repeated trials. These algorithms are widely used in various fields, including machine learning and optimization.

### Las Vegas Algorithm with KNN

The Las Vegas Algorithm with KNN is an approach that combines the principles of the Las Vegas Algorithm with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. In this simulation, Chavez and Bautista aim to demonstrate how the K Nearest Neighbour can be utilized to create A fair, accurate matchmaking, and improve the performance and accuracy with the Las Vegas Algorithm which incorporate randomness.

### Las Vegas Algorithm with SVM

Similar to the previous algorithm, the Las Vegas Algorithm with SVM integrates the principles of the Las Vegas Algorithm with the Support Vector Machine algorithm. This simulation showcases the application of randomness in SVM to enhance its robustness and efficiency.
